# mpesa-java-sdk
A java library for the Mpesa Daraja REST API


This sdk is not yet having a build dependency that can be used by either gradle or maven.<br/>
So this is how best you can use it.

Am currently using this do develop a springboot app and I will add springboot use case ASAP.

  <H1>Getting Started </h1>
  First , Create an app/project  in the safaricom developers portal. <br/>
  Clone or download the project this git project.<br/>
  open the project in your favourite IDE.( I used Intelij) <br/>
  
  <H1>Configuration <H1>
  
  By now you have a project opened in your IDE and valid safaricom  API_KEY and API_SECRET.<br/>
  
  now head over to the Constants class , Using your apps credentials assign these values in the Constants class.<br/>
  
  <H1>Testing </H1>
  
  To test how it works head over to the main class, uncomment the case you want to test and run the code.<br/>
  
  
  Happy Coding.....!
